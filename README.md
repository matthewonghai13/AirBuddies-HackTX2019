# AirBuddies - HackTX2019

This web application allows the user who uses American Airline flights to be paired up with passengers of similar preferences and interests. The app seeks to provide a flying environment in which the customer gets to choose his or her surroundings, resulting in increased value for the customer. For our frontend, we used a combination of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JQuery, and Javascript. For our backend, we used Javscript and collected flight data from American Airlines's Flight Engine API.

## Inspiration
Upon reflecting on many flights we've taken, both domestically and internationally, we've realized that so much time is wasted waiting to arrive at the destination. We saw an opportunity in that people who want to make the most out of their time don't have the tools to do that. We wanted to create an environment where passengers can tailor their experience at an individual level to their own preferences.

## What it does
Our web application matches passengers with other passengers who share their own interests. This creates a personalized experience, providing an immense source of value for passengers.

## How we built it
We used HTML/CSS and Bootstrap for front-end; as well as JavaScript, Jquery, and FlightEngineAPI (provided by American Airlines) for the back-end. We also used Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop to generate the graphics for the UI.

## Challenges we ran into
It took us some time to get used to the API and for many of us, it was our first time working across the web stack.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of our coordinated and responsive UI and our JavsScript backend (especially since this was our first time working with JavaScript). In addition to this, we were lucky to have a team full of motivated members with a good work ethic and creative ideas.

## What we learned
We learned the most about connecting the front-end to the back-end to gain experience working across an entire web tech stack to create a fully-functioning application.

## What's next for AirBuddies!
We hope to see this idea implemented with a robust back-end and database that accepts multiple user inputs. In addition to this, we'd like to further improve on scalability with the hopes of having the program be integrated within the functionality of a large scale airline.
