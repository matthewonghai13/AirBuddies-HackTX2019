# HackTX2019 - AirBuddies

This web application allows the user who uses American Airline flights to be paired up with passengers of similar preferences and interests. The app seeks to provide a flying environment in which the customer gets to choose his or her surroundings, resulting in increased value for the customer. For our frontend, we used a combination of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JQuery, and Javascript. For our backend, we used Javscript and collected flight data from American Airlines's Flight Engine API.
